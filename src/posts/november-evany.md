# 🍂 November 2 Update: Early Labubu Buzz, Mini Chases & A Special Birthday Shoutout

Before diving into today’s early-November Labubu roundup, I want to start with something close to my heart —  
**it was my little one’s birthday today. Happy Birthday, Evany!** 🎉💖  
Thank you for all filling my life with so much joy and the best kind of chaos. 💛

Now, let’s jump into what the Labubu community has been buzzing about at the start of this month.

## ⭐ Early November: A Strong Start for Labubu Fans

The first few days of November have already brought a surprising amount of movement in the Labubu world. Collectors are active, trades are speeding up, and the Mini Labubu obsession is nowhere near slowing down.

Even without major themed releases yet, energy in the community is high, fueled by:

- Nonstop **TikTok Shop restocks**  
- Strong trading activity  
- Growing hype for upcoming winter and holiday drops  
- Ongoing Mini Labubu letter-chasing  

The beginning of November is setting the tone for a busy collector month.

## 🔠 Mini Labubu Initial Chasing: The Trend Continues

Mini Labubus remain the hottest item going into November. The alphabet series has created one of the biggest micro-trends POP MART has ever seen — and the conversations happening this early in the month show it’s not slowing down.

### What Collectors Are Focusing On:
- Building **complete name sets**  
- Hunting down **rare initials**  
- Matching Minis with keychains, bags, and holiday gifts  
- Trading duplicates extremely quickly on TikTok and Discord  

Some collectors are even starting **family initial sets**, where each family member is represented by a Mini pendant — and November is the perfect month for it.

## 🛒 TikTok Shop Activity: The Early Month Rush

The start of November has already shown heavy TikTok traffic, especially during evening hours. POP MART and its partner creators have pushed restocks more frequently than usual this month, likely to keep momentum going before holiday releases.

### What We’re Seeing So Far:
- Multiple **Mini Labubu restocks** within the first 48 hours of the month  
- Faster-than-ever sellouts (some gone in under 15 seconds)  
- Increased **creator-driven drops**  
- Slightly higher bundle frequency (Minis + letter accessories)  

Collectors are reporting that **7 PM PT / 10 PM ET** is still the most reliable restock window — though surprise drops have happened midday as well.

## 🧊 Holiday Drop Teasing Begins

With November just starting, holiday hints are already popping up across social channels and fan communities. POP MART traditionally releases winter or holiday-themed Labubu lines, and early signs point toward:

- Frosted or icy color palettes  
- Cozy winter outfits or scarf versions  
- Mini gift sets and ornaments  
- Plush refreshes  

Nothing official yet — but early-month chatter is buzzing with predictions. It’s safe to assume December will be *big*.

## 📈 Early November Market Trends

We’re only two days into the month, but trends are already shaping up:

### ⬆️ Rising Interest  
New collectors continue to join TikTok drops daily.

### ⬆️ Trade Momentum  
Initials like A, L, M, S, and E are already trending higher this month.

### ⬇️ No Slowdown in Competition  
Collectors expecting post-October cooldown were surprised — activity is still intense.

### 🧩 Remote Trading  
More collectors are offering trades via TikTok comments and livestream Q&As.

Early November is proving to be just as active as October, even without major releases yet.
