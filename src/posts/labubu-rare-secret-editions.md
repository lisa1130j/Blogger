Before we dive into today’s topic on Labubu’s rare and secret editions, I want to take a moment to celebrate something close to my heart —

You bring so much joy, color, and magic into my world, just like the rarest Labubu figures themselves.

In Pop Mart’s Labubu blind box series, most boxes contain a standard figure. But every set hides treasures — the **secret editions** and ultra-rare colorways that drive collectors wild.

These figures are the heart of the chase, the mystery behind every unboxing, and the reason some collectors stay up for restocks and camp out for releases.

## What Are Secret Editions?  
Secret editions are Labubu figures with alternate designs that are **not pictured** on the box. POP MART deliberately hides them to add excitement and rarity to each series.

They often feature:
- Unique outfits  
- Alternate sculpts  
- Metallic, neon, or glitter finishes  
- Special holiday or event variants  
- Glow-in-the-dark or transparent elements  

Finding one feels like striking gold — and for many collectors, it becomes the highlight of their entire collection.

## How Rare Are They?  
Most secret editions have a rarity of **1 in 144** boxes, though some collaboration pieces can go even lower, depending on the series and artist partnership.

That scarcity is why these figures regularly resell for **3× to 10× their original price**, and in some cases far beyond that if demand spikes or the character becomes iconic.

## Popular Rare Editions  
Here are a few fan favorites that consistently rank high among collectors:

- **Labubu Skeleton Glow** – Transparent body with glowing bone details; iconic among glow collectors.  
- **Labubu Vampire** – A Halloween release with dark cape and pale spooky charm.  
- **Rainbow Labubu** – Pastel gradient finishing, often found in earlier “The Monsters” series.

## Tips for Spotting Fakes  
As rare Labubus grow in value, so do counterfeits. Here’s how to protect your collection:

- Always look for **POP MART’s authenticity code** on the box and verify it.  
- Check the **paint precision** — official figures have clean lines, proper shading, and high-quality molding.  
- Compare with official product photos; fakes often have incorrect colors or proportions.  
- Request photos of the **box, card, and figure together** before buying from resellers.  
- Be cautious of prices that seem too good to be true — they usually are.
