Labubus are more than just collectibles — they’re little mood boosters with big personality. Whether you’re shooting photos, decorating a shelf, or bringing a travel buddy, here are fun, safe places to take your Labubus.

## 1) Scenic Outdoors
Beaches, parks, botanical gardens, hiking overlooks.
**Photo tip:** Use a small clear acrylic base or poster putty so your Labubu stands on uneven ground.

## 2) Cute Cafés & Coffee Shops
Pair a pastel latte with a Labubu close-up.
**Composition tip:** Put the cup in the background and focus on Labubu at ~30–50cm for creamy bokeh.

## 3) City Landmarks & Street Art
Make “postcard” shots in front of murals or monuments.
**Framing tip:** Shoot low so Labubu fills the foreground and the landmark sits higher in the frame.

## 4) Seasonal Spots
Cherry blossoms, pumpkin patches, holiday lights, night markets.
**Lighting tip:** Golden hour or soft overcast keeps colors true and reduces harsh shadows.

## 5) At-Home Mini Scenes
Bookshelves, desk setups, tiny dioramas, or themed shelves.
**Safety tip:** Keep away from direct sun to prevent yellowing; dust with a soft makeup brush.

## Carry & Care
- Use a small padded case or camera wrap.
- Bring a microfiber cloth for quick cleanup.
- Avoid sand/water contact; keep silica gel in your case.

## Quick Display Ideas
- **Mint-themed shelf:** Pastel risers + LED strip at 20–30% brightness.
- **Acrylic risers:** Stagger heights for a “gallery” look.
- **Shadow box:** Add pastel paper backdrops for easy swaps.
