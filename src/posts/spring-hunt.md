As the flowers start to bloom and the days get longer, something magical happens in the collector’s world — **spring Labubu hunts** begin! This is one of the best times of the year for spotting rare and seasonal designs, and if you know where to look, you can come home with a treasure.

## Why Spring Is Special for Collectors
Spring often coincides with **new product launches** and **special themed releases**. Pop Mart and similar stores love to tie their drops to seasonal celebrations like Easter or Cherry Blossom festivals, and many of these designs never get restocked.

## Where to Look
- **Pop Mart Official Stores** – Ask about their seasonal lineup; sometimes they have hidden display items.
- **Toy Conventions** – Spring shows often debut exclusives.
- **Pop-Up Events** – These temporary stands in malls or fairs can surprise you with rare pieces.

## Insider Strategies
1. **Visit Early** – Seasonal stock moves quickly, often selling out in the first day or two.
2. **Check the Back of the Shelves** – Rare designs sometimes get hidden behind common ones.
3. **Network with Other Collectors** – They might share insider tips about fresh arrivals.

## Final Thoughts
Spring isn’t just about blooming flowers — it’s about blooming collections. Keep your eyes sharp, your calendar ready, and your wallet on standby. The next rare Labubu might be just around the corner.
