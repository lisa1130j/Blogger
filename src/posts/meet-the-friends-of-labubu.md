Labubu may be the star, but it’s far from the only resident in Kasing Lung’s charmingly strange universe.  
Here’s your guide to the supporting cast — each with their own personality, style, and devoted fanbase.

---

## 1. The Monsters  
A group of small, expressive creatures with big emotions. Some are shy, others are bold, and their designs often reflect fantasy and fairy-tale influences.

---

## 2. Tycoco  
A fox-like character with a laid-back personality and a love for lounging in comfy places.  
Collectors adore Tycoco for its softer color palettes and cozy vibes.

---

## 3. Pino & Momo  
Two tiny, cheerful critters often spotted together. They’re inseparable — and a reminder of the “friendship” theme in Kasing Lung’s world.

---

## 4. The Monsters’ Forest  
Many of Labubu’s friends come from this magical woodland. It’s where most of Kasing Lung’s stories take place, and it’s filled with hidden nooks, waterfalls, and mystical plants.

---

## Why They Matter  
Labubu’s friends give collectors more variety — and when they appear in crossover blind box series, the hunt becomes even more exciting.
