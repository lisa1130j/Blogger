Summer is prime hunting season for collectors. Conventions, restocks, and clearance sales all make this a time to be on high alert.

## Where to Look
- **Pop Mart Seasonal Releases** – Summer often brings playful, beachy themes.
- **Anime & Comic Conventions** – Vendors frequently carry rare stock.
- **Online Flash Sales** – Many shops run short-term summer deals.

## Hunting Tips
1. **Plan Around Big Events** – Stores often restock right before conventions.
2. **Join Mailing Lists** – Get notified before the general public.
3. **Watch Collector Forums** – Fellow fans often post real-time stock updates.

**Final Tip:** Keep a small budget aside for impulse finds — the best pieces often appear when you least expect them.
