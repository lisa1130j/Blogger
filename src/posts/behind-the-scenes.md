When we unwrap a new Labubu figure, most of us focus on the joy of the reveal — the character’s quirky face, the vibrant colors, the little details. But have you ever wondered how these adorable creatures come to life?

Today, we’re pulling back the curtain on the **design process** behind Labubu figures.

## From Sketch to Shelf

### 1. Concept Art
Every Labubu starts as a simple idea. Designers brainstorm themes, from seasonal concepts like "Winter Wonderland" to whimsical ideas like "Labubu in Space." Dozens of sketches are created, but only a handful make it past the first round.

### 2. Digital Sculpting
Once a design is chosen, artists use 3D modeling software to sculpt a detailed prototype. This allows them to experiment with facial expressions, accessories, and posture before any physical model is made.

### 3. Prototyping & Paint Tests
A 3D-printed version of the figure is produced, often in resin. Designers hand-paint this prototype to see how colors interact. Sometimes they try multiple color palettes before deciding on the final look.

### 4. Production
After approvals, molds are created for mass production. Every figure is carefully cast, painted, and inspected — and yes, there’s still some hand-finishing involved.

## Why This Matters to Collectors
Understanding the process makes us appreciate just how much work goes into each Labubu. It also explains why certain figures are rare: a special paint application or unique accessory can increase production time, making them less common.

## Fun Fact
Some designers hide tiny “Easter eggs” in the figures — a small detail or pattern that nods to past collections. Next time you open a blind box, look closely!

**Final Thought:** Labubus aren’t just toys; they’re the result of months (sometimes years) of creative work. Next time you add one to your collection, take a moment to admire the artistry that brought it to life.
