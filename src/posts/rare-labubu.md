# Rare Labubu Figures

While all Labubu figures are adorable (and slightly cheeky), some stand out as **holy grails** for serious collectors. These rare editions often sell out within minutes of release and can fetch hundreds of dollars in the resale market.

## Why They're Special

1. **Limited Production Runs** – Some figures are only made in a few hundred units.
2. **Event Exclusives** – Certain editions are only available at conventions or Pop Mart flagship stores.
3. **Special Materials** – Glow-in-the-dark paint, metallic finishes, or flocked (fuzzy) textures.

## Notable Examples

- **Glow-in-the-Dark Labubu** – Popular for its whimsical appearance when the lights go out.
- **Gold Labubu (Pop Mart Anniversary Edition)** – Released to celebrate Pop Mart’s milestone; highly sought after.
- **Winter Wonderland Labubu** – Features a cozy winter outfit and snowflake accessories.
- **Labubu Pirate Captain** – A fan favorite from the “Labubu Adventures” series.

## How to Spot a Rare Edition

Collectors often check:
- Official Pop Mart release announcements
- Serial numbers or authenticity certificates
- Packaging differences (holographic stickers, special boxes)
