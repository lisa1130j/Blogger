## 1. Who is Kasing Lung?

Labubu’s story begins with **Kasing Lung**, a Hong Kong-born artist now based in Belgium.  
Known for his whimsical, sometimes eerie characters, Lung blends European fairy-tale influence with a dash of surrealism. His worlds often feature curious creatures — part cute, part creepy — and Labubu stands as the crown jewel of his creations.

## 2. The Birth of Labubu

Labubu wasn’t designed to be just “cute.”  
With sharp teeth, oversized ears, and a cheeky grin, Labubu was meant to be a **playful troublemaker** — the kind of character who steals your candy but still makes you laugh.

The name “Labubu” itself is whimsical, with no official meaning, though Lung has hinted it’s meant to capture the sound of something light and bouncy.

## 3. From Art Print to Pop Mart Superstar

In the mid-2010s, **Pop Mart**, China’s largest designer toy company, noticed Labubu’s growing fanbase in art circles and collaborated with Lung to produce blind box figures.  

The result?  
Instant sellouts.  
Each Labubu series was released in limited quantities, encouraging collectors to hunt for rare colorways and “secret” editions — some of which fetch **hundreds of dollars** on the resale market.
