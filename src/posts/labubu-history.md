# The History of Labubu in Pop Mart Collections

Labubu’s journey from an illustrated character to a global collectible phenomenon is a fascinating one.

## Early Beginnings

Created by artist **Kasing Lung**, Labubu first appeared in his storybooks. The character was known for wandering through mysterious, dream-like worlds, encountering whimsical (and sometimes creepy) creatures.

## Partnership with Pop Mart

Pop Mart saw the potential of Labubu’s distinct look and partnered with Lung to create the first **Labubu blind box series**. These early series were simple but full of personality.

## Expansion of the Labubu Universe

Following strong demand, Pop Mart expanded the line with:
- **Seasonal Series** – Spring blossoms, summer beach, autumn harvest, and winter wonderland.
- **Adventure Series** – Pirate, space explorer, jungle adventurer.
- **Collaborations** – Labubu dressed in styles inspired by other Pop Mart characters.

## Labubu Today

Labubu now enjoys a global fanbase. Limited editions sell out almost instantly, and online forums are buzzing with trading, collecting tips, and display ideas.

**Looking Ahead:** Given its popularity, Labubu’s universe will likely keep expanding with even more creative crossovers and rare editions.
