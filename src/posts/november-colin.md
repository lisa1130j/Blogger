My fierce gamer, I love celebrating you. Now let’s get into the November Labubu madness!

November is here, and the Labubu community is overflowing with energy. After the explosive Mini Labubu launch earlier this fall, fans are entering the holiday season with heightened anticipation, more restocks, and some of the fastest sellouts we’ve ever seen.

This month is all about *momentum*: TikTok Shop drops, rising demand, holiday teasers, and shifting market trends that every collector should pay attention to. Let’s dive into everything happening across the Labubusphere this November.

## ⭐ Mini LABUBU: Still the Breakout Star of Fall

Even months after launch, **Mini Labubus remain the most talked-about Labubu release of 2025**. Their alphabet-based designs have become a collector sensation, turning each pendant into a personalized treasure.

### Why Minis Are Dominating This Month
Fans are still hunting Minis because they are:

- **Highly personal** – everyone wants their initials  
- **Portable** – they clip to bags, lanyards, keys, or phone charms  
- **Affordable** – a great entry point for new collectors  
- **Trade-friendly** – easy swaps inside the community  
- **Holiday-ready** – small enough for stocking stuffers, letters, and gifts  

The demand didn’t cool off after launch — it actually intensified.
