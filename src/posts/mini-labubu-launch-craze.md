##  The Rush and the Crash

According to multiple reports, the new mini-sized Labubu pendants — part of *The Monsters: Pin For Love* line at **$22.99 each** — sold out within minutes. So much traffic piled onto Pop Mart’s platforms that the **WeChat store froze**, and several fans reported the main store site crashing completely.

##  Collector Frustration: Fans Speak Out

On Reddit, members of collector communities described mounting frustration:

> “It let me tap the pay and then it crashed.”  
> “I had two boxes in my cart... when I tried to checkout, it failed.”  
> “The app crashes every time the drop happens.”

These glitches injected stress into the buy cycle—many shared screenshots of “network error,” failed checkouts, and empty carts.
