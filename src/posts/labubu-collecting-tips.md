# Top 5 Tips for New Labubu Collectors

Collecting Labubu is a rewarding hobby — but like all collectibles, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Here are my top tips for starting and growing your collection.

## 1. Join Collector Communities

Facebook groups, Discord servers, and Instagram hashtags (#LabubuCollection) are great for learning about new releases, trades, and meetups.

## 2. Set a Budget

Rare Labubu figures can go for **2–5 times** their original retail price on the secondary market. Decide what you’re willing to spend before chasing a rare piece.

## 3. Track Release Dates

Pop Mart releases often happen in waves. Following their official WeChat, Instagram, or website will help you snag figures before they sell out.

## 4. Protect Your Figures

Display cases not only keep dust away but also protect from accidental falls and sunlight damage that can cause paint fading.

## 5. Buy What You Love

The best collections are personal. Don’t just chase value — pick designs that make you smile.

**Collector Wisdom:** "One Labubu leads to another." Many collectors start with one figure and end up building an entire display wall.
