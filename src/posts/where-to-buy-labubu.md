Labubu may be a Pop Mart creation, but you don’t have to rely only on their stores or online shop to grow your collection.  
Here’s how to track down figures — both new and rare — from multiple sources.

---

## 1. Pop Mart Official Channels  
- **Physical Stores** — Best for buying newly released series.  
- **Online Store** — Ships internationally with seasonal discounts.  
- **Tmall & JD.com** — Pop Mart’s official China marketplaces.

---

## 2. Local Toy Stores & Collectible Shops  
Many independent stores carry Pop Mart products.  
Some even host **trade nights** for collectors.

---

## 3. Online Marketplaces  
- **eBay** — Great for older series and rare finds.  
- **Mercari & Yahoo Japan Auctions** — Popular in Japan for collectibles.  
- **Carousell** — Used across Asia for secondhand trading.

---

## 4. Collector Communities  
- **Facebook Groups** — Search for “Labubu Collectors” or “Pop Mart Trading.”  
- **Discord Servers** — Live trade chats and buy/sell listings.  
- **Instagram Hashtags** — Follow `#Labubu` to find collectors.

## 5. Events & Conventions
